It’s probably Jekyll that’s blocking that folder from being included in your deploy.
Jekyll is run be default and ignores folders that start with certain characters.

It looks like you’re not using Jekyll so you can disable it by creating an empty file called
.nojekyll in the root of your gh-pages branch. Once you’ve done that any folders starting
with . should be included in your site build.
